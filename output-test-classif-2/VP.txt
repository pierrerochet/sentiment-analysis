And as we pull closer, I see something.	0,908
And it's right to do whatever necessary to provide our children the care and the education they need to live up to their God-given potential.	0,879
And so it's time to put aside partisan differences and just talk about what works for our kids and what will keep America competitive in this new century.	0,858
And it's right to always provide the very best care for the very best of America.	0,827
And it happened because John Lewis and scores of brave Americans stood on that bridge and lived to cross it.	0,825
And now it's time for us to prove to the world that we can still play better than anyone.	0,815
And we can do better, think bigger, and act bolder when it comes to education in this country.	0,809
And keep saying it.	0,805
And it's right to expect that if you're willing to work hard in this country of American Dreamers, the sky is the limit on what you can achieve.	0,788
In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; the belief in things not seen; the belief that there are better days ahead.	0,783
The good news is that we have the resources, we have the brainpower, and we are still an economic and technological giant.	0,782
Thank you and God bless you.	0,781
And so there was struggle and sacrifice, discipline and tremendous courage.	0,780
For me, this kind of hope often comes from a memory of a trip I took during the campaign.	0,777
My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation.	0,769
Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy.	0,757
Thank you for marching again.	0,755
Out of many, one.	0,748
A few years back, Suzanne had a good job as a nurse and a home on Chicago's Northwest Side.	0,740
On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deep gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.	0,728
Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.	0,724
But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all.	0,724
Happy Birthday John.	0,709
She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas.	0,706
That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."	0,697
And so it was, in a story as old as our beginnings and as timeless as our hopes, that change came about because the good people of a great nation willed it so.	0,691
Thank you for reminding us that in America, ordinary citizens can somehow find in their hearts the courage to do extraordinary things.	0,678
It's great to be here with all of you today, and I'm honored that you've given me the opportunity to join this discussion about the role technology can play in our future and our children's future.	0,678
I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity.	0,656
It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family.	0,654
But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day - after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them...after all that, they went back to march again.	0,653
This is the great project for our time, and so it must become a larger part of the debate in our politics, our businesses, our schools and our homes.	0,646
Thank you.	0,633
Thank you.	0,633
Thank you.	0,633
I believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us.	0,624
As parents and citizens, each of us has a stake in making sure that our schools are doing everything possible to give our kids the competitive edge they'll need in a 21st century economy.	0,622
To do this, we must start by inspiring our children with a sense of purpose...by nurturing their imagination so that they may dream big and then work hard to reach those dreams.	0,619
Because people like John Lewis and Hosea Williams and Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks and thousands of ordinary Americans with extraordinary courage have helped bend it that way.	0,606
Our schools must begin instilling that wonder in our children again so that their generation will unite around the next great project of our time, whether it be declaring America energy independent or launching the next great technological revolution.	0,604
They work hard, they love their children, and they're willing to do anything to give them the best possible shot in life.	0,601
It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.	0,593
and walks away.	0,591
I believe it is the hope of knowing that people like John Lewis have stood on that same bridge and lived to cross it.	0,563
So for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children, let us send a clear message to the president.	0,553
When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.	0,553
That's why charter schools are a great way for us to learn from experiments in Topeka and Springfield that schools in Chicago and L.A. can replicate in their own classrooms.	0,551
We can't leave kids behind before they even enter the first grade, and that's why I'll continue to focus on early childhood education as a way to give them the best start in life.	0,548
And as their examples call out to us from across the generations, we continue to progress as a people because they inspire us to take our own two hands and bend that arc.	0,543
And so we must change with them.	0,539
Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer.	0,534
What's more, they know that when it comes to the high-tech, high skill jobs of the future, their children are not only competing with children here in the United States, but with those on the other side of the globe who are increasingly being educated earlier, longer, and with a special emphasis on the math and science skills required for the industries of tomorrow.	0,531
His parents were never the type to complain or try to stir up any trouble, and yet their son sought justice.	0,518
We live in a rapidly changing world with an economy that's moving just as fast.	0,516
And in the coming months, I will do my best to work with my colleagues and make sure our government is ready too.	0,515
How far we've come from the days when the son of sharecroppers would huddle by the radio as the crackle of Dr. King's dreams filled his heart with hope.	0,506
And where will our courage come from to speak these truths?	0,502
Blacks and whites, teenagers and children, teachers and bankers and shopkeepers - a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom.	0,498
Thank you John.	0,494
The audacity of hope!	0,486
After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west in search of opportunity.	0,485

John Kerry calls on us to hope.	0,459
John Edwards calls on us to hope.	0,459
Mr. President, this bill gives us a rare chance to ask ourselves who we're here to protect - who we're here to stand up and speak out for.	0,459
All across America, world-class universities, first-rate research facilities and brilliant minds are on the cusp of discovering the next big idea that will lift up the quality of our lives, create millions of new jobs, and change our world.	0,454
And if we're going to crack down on bankruptcy abuse, we should make it clear that we intend to hold the wealthy and the powerful accountable too.	0,451
He was a good-looking kid, six-two or six-three, clear-eyed, with an easy smile.	0,446
John Doer's work with the New Schools Venture Fund is leading the way on this front, and we should all commend him for that.	0,437
Thank you, John, for going back.	0,423
It's an honor to be here tonight to celebrate one of the most courageous and compassionate Americans of our time.	0,418
And so, while I cannot support this bill the way it is written, I do look forward to working with my colleagues in amending this bill so that we can still keep that promise alive.	0,416
He fought in the name of a larger freedom, part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil.	0,414
This issue should force us to face a fundamental question about who we are as a country, how we progress as a society, and where our values lie as a people: How do we treat our fellow Americans who have fallen on hard times, and what is our responsibility to cushion those falls when they occur?	0,399
And keep saying it until other voices join the chorus to sing the songs that set us free.	0,384
His values and his record affirm what is best in us.	0,381
And we wind our way through the town and we go past the old courthouse, take a turn and suddenly we're in a big parking lot and about 300 people are standing there.	0,377
We are here because we believe that all men are created equal, and that we are all connected to each other as one people.	0,375
Today, we need that courage.	0,373
We also know that some of the best ideas in education don't come from Washington, but from local schools all over America.	0,367
Thank you Rick.	0,362
Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to address this pending legislation.	0,362
When we stand on our own Edmund Pettus Bridge, what hope will sustain us?	0,352
That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams of its people, the insistence on small miracles.	0,350
That's a worthy goal, and we can all agree that bankruptcy was never meant to serve as a Get Out of Jail Free Card, for use when you've foolishly gambled away all your savings and don't feel like taking responsibility for your actions.	0,349
I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my precious daughters.	0,346
It bends because we help it bend that way.	0,340
We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.	0,335
For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga.	0,324
A ruthless man.	0,300
John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded.	0,290
