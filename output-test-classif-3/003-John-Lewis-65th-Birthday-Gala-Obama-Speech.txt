They crossed the bridge.	0,788
It was about 30 years ago.	0,683
That while there may be room for moral ambiguity in the issues we debate today, civil rights was different.	0,672
And they start waving.	0,654
But it happened.	0,640
All of these people are wearing these little buttons that say "Obama for U.S. Senate."	0,614
But the road to change never is.	0,609
And say it again.	0,572
And say it again.	0,572
And we need to say that more.	0,562
How far we've come because of your courage, John.	0,548
I think it's simple for us to look back forty years and think that it was all so clear then.	0,530
He's right, but you know what?	0,519
I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day.	0,488
And say it louder.	0,479
And they start smiling.	0,455
About a fourth of them are black and three fourths are white and they all are about the age where they would have been active participants in the epic struggle that had taken place thirty years earlier.	0,448
They marched again.	0,429
May God Bless you, and may God Bless these United States of America.	0,424

And as we pull closer, I see something.	0,908
And it's right to do whatever necessary to provide our children the care and the education they need to live up to their God-given potential.	0,879
And it's right to always provide the very best care for the very best of America.	0,827
And it happened because John Lewis and scores of brave Americans stood on that bridge and lived to cross it.	0,825
And keep saying it.	0,805
And it's right to expect that if you're willing to work hard in this country of American Dreamers, the sky is the limit on what you can achieve.	0,788
And so there was struggle and sacrifice, discipline and tremendous courage.	0,780
For me, this kind of hope often comes from a memory of a trip I took during the campaign.	0,777
Thank you for marching again.	0,755
Happy Birthday John.	0,709
And so it was, in a story as old as our beginnings and as timeless as our hopes, that change came about because the good people of a great nation willed it so.	0,691
Thank you for reminding us that in America, ordinary citizens can somehow find in their hearts the courage to do extraordinary things.	0,678
But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day - after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them...after all that, they went back to march again.	0,653
Thank you.	0,633
Because people like John Lewis and Hosea Williams and Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks and thousands of ordinary Americans with extraordinary courage have helped bend it that way.	0,606
and walks away.	0,591
I believe it is the hope of knowing that people like John Lewis have stood on that same bridge and lived to cross it.	0,563
And as their examples call out to us from across the generations, we continue to progress as a people because they inspire us to take our own two hands and bend that arc.	0,543
His parents were never the type to complain or try to stir up any trouble, and yet their son sought justice.	0,518
How far we've come from the days when the son of sharecroppers would huddle by the radio as the crackle of Dr. King's dreams filled his heart with hope.	0,506
And where will our courage come from to speak these truths?	0,502
Blacks and whites, teenagers and children, teachers and bankers and shopkeepers - a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom.	0,498
Thank you John.	0,494
He spoke truths, even when they tried to silence his words.	0,462
Thank you, John, for going back.	0,423
It's an honor to be here tonight to celebrate one of the most courageous and compassionate Americans of our time.	0,418
And keep saying it until other voices join the chorus to sing the songs that set us free.	0,384
And we wind our way through the town and we go past the old courthouse, take a turn and suddenly we're in a big parking lot and about 300 people are standing there.	0,377
We are here because we believe that all men are created equal, and that we are all connected to each other as one people.	0,375
Today, we need that courage.	0,373
When we stand on our own Edmund Pettus Bridge, what hope will sustain us?	0,352
It bends because we help it bend that way.	0,340

And as Dick's getting out of the car, the driver says "excuse me, let me just give you a piece of advice.	0,728
And we're riding down to Cairo and Dick Durbin turns to me and says, "Let me tell you about the first time I went to Cairo.	0,723
And if there's anything we can learn from this living saint sitting beside me, it is that change is never easy, but always possible.	0,712
And there was a time not long before that when people might never have guessed that someday, African-Americans would be able to go to the polls, pick up a ballot, make their voice heard, and elect that Congress.	0,702
When I was first asked to speak here, I thought to myself, never in a million years would I have guessed that I'd be serving in Congress with John Lewis.	0,687
We need the courage to say that it's wrong that one out of every five children is born into poverty in the richest country on Earth.	0,684
I was 23 years old and Paul Simon, who was Lieutenant Governor at the time, sent me down there to investigate what could be done to improve the racial climate in Cairo."	0,670
And one of the towns we went to was a place called Cairo, which, as many of you might know, achieved a certain notoriety during the late 60s and early 70s as having one of the worst racial climates in the country.	0,668
And Dick tells me how he diligently goes down there and gets picked up by a local resident who takes him to his motel.	0,662
And he marched, even when they tried to knock him down again and again and again.	0,638
He was often forced to leave school to work in the fields and the public library was off-limits to his kind, and yet young John Lewis sought knowledge.	0,624
They awakened a nation's conscience, and not five months later, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law.	0,606
About a week after the primary, Dick Durbin and I embarked on a nineteen city tour of Southern Illinois.	0,602
It's wrong to tell those brave men and women who are willing to fight and die for this country that when they come home, we may not have room for them at the VA hospitals or the benefits we promised them.	0,595
You had an active white citizen's council there, you had cross burnings, Jewish families were being harassed, you had segregated schools, race riots, you name it - it was going on in Cairo.	0,594
It doesn't bend on its own.	0,580
Don't use the phone in your motel room because the switchboard operator is a member of the white citizen's council, and they'll report on anything you do."	0,577
Because if you told Dick thirty years ago that he - the son of Lithuania immigrants born into very modest means in east St. Louis - would be returning to Cairo as a sitting United States Senator, and that he would have in tow a black guy born in Hawaii with a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas named Barack Obama, no one would have believed it.	0,572
Today, I'm sure you'll all agree that we have songs left to sing and bridges left to cross.	0,571
So I'm wondering what kind of reception we're going to get.	0,570
It's wrong to tell hardworking families who are earning less and paying more in taxes that we can't do anything to help them buy their own home or send their kids to college or care for them when they're sick.	0,550
He opens up the door and there's a guy standing there who just stares at Dick for a second, and then says, "What the hell are you doing here?"	0,547
And there was the culmination of it all one Sunday afternoon on a bridge in Alabama.	0,541
My friends, we have not come this far as a people and a nation because we believe that we're better off simply fending for ourselves.	0,532
Because they were willing to spend sleepless nights in lonely jail cells, endure the searing pain of billy clubs cracked against their bones, and face down death simply so that all of us could share equally in the joys of life.	0,530
That people generally knew what was right and what was wrong, who the good guys and the bad guys were.	0,530
You know, two weeks after Bloody Sunday, when the march finally reached Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to the crowd of thousands and said "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."	0,526
And I wonder, where did they find that kind of courage?	0,526
That in the face of the fiercest resistance and the most crushing oppression, one voice can be willing to stand up and say that's wrong and this is right and here's why.	0,521
But we can, and I'm here, because people like John Lewis believed.	0,517
When you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gas...when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the Lord for salvation?	0,513
And so he organized, even when so many tried to stop his efforts.	0,513
Well, now Dick is really feeling concerned and so am I because as he's telling me this story, we're pulling in to Cairo.	0,506
And then I thought, you know, there was once a time when John Lewis might never have guessed that he'd be serving in Congress.	0,502
Not only John and Hosea Williams leading the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it.	0,497
Because people like John Lewis feared nothing and risked everything for those beliefs.	0,482
But the moral certainties we now take for granted - that separate can never be equal, that the blessings of liberty enshrined in our Constitution belong to all of us, that our children should be able to go to school together and play together and grow up together - were anything but certain when John Lewis was a boy.	0,481
Truly, this is the audacity of hope.	0,466
And Dick and I looked at each other and didn't have to say a thing.	0,450
Well, this obviously makes Dick Durbin upset, but he's a brave young man, so he checks in to his room, unpacks his bags and a few minutes later he hears a knock on the door.	0,422
The road John chose for himself was not easy.	0,406
That it comes not from violence or militancy or the kind of politics that pits us against each other and plays on our worst fears; but from great discipline and organization, from a strong message of hope, and from the courage to turn against the tide so that the tide eventually may be turned.	0,371
