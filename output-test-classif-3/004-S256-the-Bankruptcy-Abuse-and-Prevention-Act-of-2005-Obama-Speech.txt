They did their part.	0,868
Then she suffered a stroke that left her hospitalized for five-days.	0,717
Take the case of Suzanne Gibbons.	0,709
They spent their lives working hard.	0,656
It's the face of middle-class America.	0,535
Now, it would be one thing if most people were abusing the system and falling into bankruptcy because they were irresponsible with their finances.	0,474
This bill does a great job protecting credit card companies from the few bad apples who try to escape their debt, but what does it do to protect the American public from the credit card companies who try to take advantage of them?	0,461
We all want that.	0,433
What kind of a message does it send when we tell hardworking, middle-class Americans, "You have to be more responsible with your finances, but the corporations you work for can be as irresponsible as they want with theirs"?	0,432


### VN
Business owners and creditors deserve the money they're owed, and anyone who tries to scam the system just because they can should be stopped and forced to pay their debt.	0,718
As Senator Dodd, Senator Feinstein, and others have pointed out, this bill also fails to deal with the aggressive marketing practices and hidden fees credit card companies have used to raise their profits and our debt.	0,605


### VP
A few years back, Suzanne had a good job as a nurse and a home on Chicago's Northwest Side.	0,740
Thank you.	0,633
They work hard, they love their children, and they're willing to do anything to give them the best possible shot in life.	0,601
We live in a rapidly changing world with an economy that's moving just as fast.	0,516
They're saving every extra penny they have so that their children can someday do better than they did.	0,473
Mr. President, this bill gives us a rare chance to ask ourselves who we're here to protect - who we're here to stand up and speak out for.	0,459
And if we're going to crack down on bankruptcy abuse, we should make it clear that we intend to hold the wealthy and the powerful accountable too.	0,451
And so, while I cannot support this bill the way it is written, I do look forward to working with my colleagues in amending this bill so that we can still keep that promise alive.	0,416
This issue should force us to face a fundamental question about who we are as a country, how we progress as a society, and where our values lie as a people: How do we treat our fellow Americans who have fallen on hard times, and what is our responsibility to cushion those falls when they occur?	0,399
Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to address this pending legislation.	0,362
That's a worthy goal, and we can all agree that bankruptcy was never meant to serve as a Get Out of Jail Free Card, for use when you've foolishly gambled away all your savings and don't feel like taking responsibility for your actions.	0,349


### N
We must reform our bankruptcy code so that corporations keep their promises and meet their obligations to their workers.	0,737
We need to end these practices so that we're making life easier not just for the credit card companies, but for honest, hardworking middle-class families.	0,733
We also know what else has gone up: the cost of child care and the cost of college, the cost home ownership and the cost of health care - which is now at a record high.	0,726
And even though she had health insurance through her job, it only covered $4,000 of her $53,000 hospital bill.	0,704
And after all that, she still may have been told that she was ineligible for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.	0,688
We should curb bankruptcy abuse and to demand a measure of personal responsibility from people.	0,681
And so, as much as we'd like to believe that the face of this bankruptcy crisis is credit card addicts who spend their way into debt, the truth is that it's the face of people like Suzanne Gibbons.	0,678
And it would also require companies that emerge from bankruptcy to immediately pay each retiree who lost health benefits an amount of cash equal to what a retiree would be expected to have to pay for COBRA coverage for 18 months.	0,676
But with just one illness, emergency, or divorce, those dreams can be wiped out.	0,675
As it is now, this bill makes it easier for a company like Enron who just bilked their employees out of their life savings to declare bankruptcy than for the employees themselves.	0,667
This is wrong.	0,666
People are working harder and longer for less, and they're falling further and further behind.	0,657
We can do better than forcing people to choose between the cost of health care and the cost of college.	0,657
We can do better than big corporations using bankruptcy laws to deny health care and benefits to their employees.	0,655
The second amendment would prevent bankruptcy courts from dismissing companies' coal act obligations to pay their workers the benefits they promised them.	0,648
And in the ten minutes since I've been talking, about thirty of them have filed for bankruptcy.	0,648
With all that debt, she would have had to hire a lawyer and pay hundreds of dollars more in increased paperwork.	0,643
If this bill passes as written, Suzanne would be treated by the law the same as any scam artist who cheats the system.	0,641
These companies made a deal to their mine workers, and they should be forced to honor that deal.	0,633
And we can give people the basic tools and protections they need to believe that in America, your circumstance is no limit to the success you may achieve and the dreams you may fulfill.	0,627
Where declaring Chapter 7 bankruptcy is made prohibitively expensive for people who already have suffered financial devastation.	0,621
Charging a penalty to consumers who make a late payment on a completely unrelated credit card is just one example of these tactics.	0,620
In my own state, we even had a mining company by the name of Horizon declare bankruptcy and then refuse to pay its employees the health benefits it owed them.	0,616
Mr. President, the bankruptcy crisis this bill should address is not just the one facing credit card companies who are enjoying record profits.	0,604
Because of her illness, she was soon forced to leave her full-time nursing job and take a temp job that paid less and didn't offer health insurance.	0,603
But Horizon didn't do its part, and it was allowed to hide behind bankruptcy laws to leave these workers without the care they had earned.	0,602
But we can do better than one bankruptcy every nineteen seconds.	0,594
Senator Rockefeller has two amendments to do this that I have co-sponsored and urge my colleagues to support.	0,593
And we know that a recent Harvard study showed that nearly half of all bankruptcies occur because of an illness that ends up sticking families with medical bills they just can't keep up with.	0,590
As bankruptcy professor Elizabeth Warren has noted, these are middle-class families with two parents who both work at good-paying jobs that put a roof over their heads.	0,588
We know that most people fall into bankruptcy as a result of bad luck.	0,586
But there are also millions of middle-class families out there who are struggling to get by.	0,579
With this bill, it doesn't matter if you ran up your debt on a trip to Vegas or a trip to the Emergency Room, you're still treated the same under the law and you still face the possibility that you'll never get the chance to start over.	0,579
Over the last thirty years bankruptcies have gone up 400% -- and we've had more than 2,100 in Illinois just last year.	0,569
And we're not talking about the poor or even just the working poor here.	0,568
She lost her retirement savings, she lost her house, and eventually, she was forced to declare bankruptcy.	0,555
We can't always control this and we can't promise that the changes will always leave everyone better off.	0,545
The decision about whether or not she can file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy would never take into account the fact that she fell into financial despair because of her illness.	0,537
Proponents claim this bill is designed to curb the worst abuses of our bankruptcy system.	0,531
It's wrong that this bill would make it harder for these unemployed workers to declare bankruptcy, while doing nothing to prevent the bankrupt company that put them there from shirking its responsibility entirely.	0,519
One would increase the required payments of wages and employee benefit plans to $15,000 per individual from the current level of $4,925.	0,510
Then the collection agencies started coming after her for hospital bills that she just couldn't keep up with.	0,475
But we know that's not the case.	0,471
This bill does a great job helping the credit card industry recover the profits they're losing, but what are we doing to help middle-class families recover the dreams they're losing?	0,442
We should be addressing middle-class families who are dealing with record hardships.	0,439
But to accomplish that, this bill would take us from a system where judges weed out the abusers from the honest to a system where all the honest are presumed to be abusers.	0,433
And while I remain hopeful that our companies want to do the right thing for their workers, doing so should not be a choice - it should be a mandate.	0,405
The Mine Workers involved had provided a total of 100,000 years of service and dedication and sacrifice to this company.	0,367
